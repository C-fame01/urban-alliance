  <h2> We serve...
    
  </h2>
    <ol>
      
      <li>Baltimore: Urban Alliance’s work in Baltimore has since expanded to include specific internship pathways for students interested in careers in construction, land surveying, and hospitality.</li>
       
      <li>Chicage: Urban Alliance was invited to bring our High School Internship Program to Chicago in 2012, serving 71 students from just seven high schools that first year. Urban Alliance also offers professional development workshops to schools and nonprofit organizations to bring critical soft skills training to even more Chicago youth.  </li>
      
      <li>Detroit: Urban Alliance (UA) brought our flagship youth employment model – the High School Internship Program – to Detroit in fall 2018. This expansion was made possible through the support of key partners in the city, especially the Quicken Loans Family of Companies – our anchor employer in Detroit – as well as our long-time partner Bank of America and new partner The Skillman Foundation.</li>
      
      <li>Northern Virginia: Urban Alliance was invited to bring our signature High School Internship Program to Northern Virginia youth in 2013. Since then, Urban Alliance has partnered with Northern Virginia businesses to connect more than 300 high school students to paid, professional internships, and provided career-readiness training to an additional 900 through community workshops. Currently, the Northern Virginia program works with 24 businesses to serve students from five high schools in Alexandria and Arlington.</li>
    
      <li>Washington, DC: In 1996, Andrew Plepler, then an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department, asked students at Anacostia High School in Washington, DC what they really needed to be successful. One young woman answered very honestly, “I need a job.” Plepler found that student an internship, and enlisted five of his friends to do the same for other students. That experience led to the creation of Urban Alliance.</li>
